summary: Super Simple Disk Benchmark
description: |
  This tool has just one single purpose, it measures the writing performance of your hard disk on macOS, Linux and Windows. More precisely spoken of the disk under your `CWD`.

  It used random data from [`rand crate`][3] and writes first sequentially chunks of 8MB until a total 1GB is written. It measures writing time and throughput.

  After that it writes this random data 8 times again on disk and measures the average writing times and throughput for this.
